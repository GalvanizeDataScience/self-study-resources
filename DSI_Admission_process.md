# Admissions Process Description

## Coding Challenge

1. Apply to the Galvanize Data Science Immersive at https://www.galvanize.com/data-science-bootcamp.
2. After completing the application, you may begin the **Coding Challenge**, to which you will see a link.
3. Upon completion of the Coding Challenge, you may book your **Technical Interview**


## Technical Interview via Google Hangout or Zoom

### Purpose of the TI
This interview is used to assess your readiness for the DSI. It is designed to survey just beyond the baseline skills necessary for success in the DSI.
Our rubric is a 4-point system where 3 and above indicate readiness:
* 4 is exceptional and rare
* 3 is achieved by roughly 1/2 of applicants in their first interview
* 2 indicates more study is necessary
* 1 indicates that many weeks, sometimes months of study will be necessary (very rare)
* Our TI scores are for internal use and we don't share them




### Overview
You will be in the technical interview for **1.25 hours**. The person interviewing you will not tell you the result of your interview. Your Enrollment Officer will reach out to you within 2 business days with your results.

You will be writing code within a Jupyter notebook on a remote virtual machine running Linux. You will connect to this remote server using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/)

You **may not** use notes or external resources (google) during this interview. You will need to write a number of Python functions within the alotted time.


### Early Exit Option
The Technical Admissions Officer will give you the option of exiting the interview upon completion of the Warm Up section. If you choose that option, the Technical Admissions Officer will recommend that you book a mentoring session, and will forward your results to a mentor who will reach out to you. After your mentoring session and a couple weeks of study, as well as completion of self-assessment materials, you will be able to book another interview. Your second interview will be the same content as the first interview, however you will not have the Early Exit Option.


### If you pass
If you meet the threshold during your interview, you will be accepted into the DSI. Before the start date for the DSI, you must complete the Pre-Course work, which will be opened to you. If you do not complete the Pre-Course, you will be asked to enter in the next DSI Start Date after you complete the Pre-Course.



### If you don't pass the interview
In General, you are welcome to interview again after 2 weeks or more of study. Not passing is NOT a rejection. We collect information on your performance and will give suggestions on where you should focus. We offer you a free mentoring session as well, in order to iron out your understandings of interview expectations, and to help focus you on materials that will best serve you. 

Remember, the purpose of our threshold is to guarantee inclusion, not to exercise exclusion, ie., we want to help you get there, so please check in with us. Most applicants who do not pass the interview on their first try will pass on their second attempt. In rare cases, an applicant will have a 3rd interview.
